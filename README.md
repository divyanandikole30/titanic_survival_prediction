**Movie Rating Prediction**
Objectives

Predict movie ratings using a comprehensive dataset.
Implement robust preprocessing and feature engineering techniques.
Explore and optimize various machine learning models.
Address challenges in data quality, imbalance, and feature dimensionality

Approach

Data Collection

Collected data from online movie databases and user review platforms.

Combined multiple datasets to include features such as movie metadata, audience ratings, and reviews.

Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values by imputing mean values for numerical features and mode for categorical features.

Encoded categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding for genres and cast members.

Processed textual data (e.g., reviews) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including tokenization, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization.

Normalized numerical features to ensure uniform scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized correlations between features and target ratings.

Identified and removed outliers using statistical methods like Z-scores.

Assessed feature importance using techniques like mutual information and correlation heatmaps.

Feature Engineering

Created new features, such as “return on investment” (ROI) from budget and revenue.

Aggregated user review sentiments into a single sentiment score using a pre-trained sentiment analysis model.

Model Selection

Tested various regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.

Performed hyperparameter tuning using grid search and randomized search techniques.

Training and Evaluation

Split data into training, validation, and test sets with an 80:10:10 ratio.

Trained models on the training set and fine-tuned them using the validation set.

Evaluated models on the test set using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.


Challenges

Data Imbalance

The dataset had an uneven distribution of ratings, with most movies concentrated around average ratings. Resolved by using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset.

High Dimensionality

The large number of features due to one-hot encoding and TF-IDF increased computational complexity. Mitigated by applying dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis).

Conclusion

This project demonstrates a systematic approach to predicting movie ratings using machine learning. By addressing challenges in data processing and model optimization, the final model achieved high predictive accuracy

Project Title
Titanic Survival Prediction

2. Introduction
This project explores the Titanic dataset to predict the likelihood of a passenger's survival based on these factors. By applying machine learning techniques, we aim to uncover patterns in the data and build models capable of making accurate survival predictions.
Example: This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on a variety of features such as age, gender, ticket class, etc., using machine learning techniques.

4. Dataset
Mention the source of the Titanic dataset (e.g., Kaggle).
Provide a brief summary of the dataset's contents.

6. Approach
 project workflow:
EDA: Understanding the dataset and exploring patterns.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
Model Building: Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models.
Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.


8. Challenges Faced
Example challenges:
Handling missing values in features like age and cabin.
Avoiding overfitting during model training.

10. Results
Highlight the key results achieved.
Example: Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 82% on the test dataset.

12. How to Run
Step-by-step instructions to replicate the results:
